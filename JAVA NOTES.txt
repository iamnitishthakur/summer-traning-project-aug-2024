WHAT IS JDK (Java development kit);
______________________________________
It is a software package. is contain java compiler, java run time environment, and java virtual machine.

JAVA COMPILER: 
__________________________
Java compiler is a type of translator, which convert source code to byte code.


JAVA RUN TIME ENVIROMENT: (JRE):
____________________________________
JRE create a layer between java application and operating system. Java application is executed under supervision of JRE.

JVM:
_____
JVM an agent of java , which convert byte code to machine code. 

Execution scenario of Java program: 
__________________________

Ex:-  import util.java.*;
public class{
public static void main(String [] args){
System.out.println("Hello World");

}
}

OUTPUT:   Hello World

Operator
_______________
Operator are symbols which are used to perform operation on operands.

1.Arithmetic operators-  
+ 	Addition
-	Subtraction
*	Multiplication
/	Division
%	modulo

2.Relational Operators- RO specifies relation between two entities.
>	Greater then			a<b
< 	Less then			a>b
>=	Greater then or equal a>=b 
=> 	Less then or equal	a=>b
==	equality				a==b
!=	Not equals			a!=b

3. Assignment Operator (=)- 

a=b;//Copies value of b to a

4.Increment Operator (++)- 	IO increase value of a variable by 1.
a++; //a=a+1; 

5. Decrement  operator (--)- 	DO decrease value of a variable by 1.
a--//a=-1;

6. Logical Operator- 

Logical operators are used to combine two or more conditions.

AND		&&
OR		||
NOT		!
 
DECISION CONTROL:
_____________________
Decision are used for decision making. If you want to execute code based on some condition then you use control. In java are following types of decision controls.
1. If Statement 
2. If-else Statement 
3.Ladder If-else Statement 
4. Switch statement 

1. IF STATEMENT -
___________________

IF is a keywords which works as decision control. We attach a condition with if Statement. If given condition is true then code will executed be  if given condition id a false then will not be executed .

ex: -  if(Condition){

//code
}

2. IF ELSE STATEMENT-
_______________________

if -else statement is variation of if statement . We attach a condition with if Statement . If given condition is true then if block code will be executed and if given condition is false then else block be executed.
Syntax: - 
if (Condition){
//if block code
 }else
{
}

3.LADDER IF ELSE:-
____________________
If you have many conditions and you want to execute to code based on those conditions. Then you can use ladder if-else.
ex: - 
if (Condition1)
{
//code 1;

}else if (Condition 2)
{

//code2;
}else{
//code3;

}
5. 

4.Switch  Statement - 
___________________
This is a keywords  Which works as a case control. And it is use to create the menu based program. 
Syntax: - 

Switch(Expression) //int , char, String;
{
care 1:
//code1
break;

case 2: 
//code2;
break;

case 3:
//code3;
break;

default:
//default code;

}
5.LOOP CONTROL IN JAVA-
_______________________
If you have a lot of code which you are to execute repeatedly up to given condition is true, then you can use the loop control. In java there are four type f loop control are available. 
1.While loop
2.for loop
3.do-while loop
4.for each loop

1.WHILE LOOP -
_______________
While is a keywords which works as loop control. 
Syntax: -
initialization of loop counter;
while(condition){
//code;
Updating of loop counter; 
}  

2. FOR LOOP-
_________________
For is a keywords which works as loop control . The working of for loop is same as while loop but syntax is different .
syntax_ 
for(initialization; condition ; increment / decrement ){
//code ;

}

3. do- while loop- (Exit control loop )-
_________________________
In do while loop condition is tested after executed of code. So do while loop is know as exit control.
Initialization of loop counter ; 
do {
//code
Updation  of loop counter ;

}
while(Condition);

* for number print in delay: - 
Thread.sleep(milliseconds);

This method generate delay. 




1. Conditional Statement
	if
	if-else
	Nested
	ladder	
	switch
	
2. What is if Statement: 
3. if-else Statement: 
4.Nested Statement:
5. Switch Statemen: 
6.

Q- What  is the purpose of loop controls how many type of loop.	
	while loop
	for loop
	do while
	for-each loop

Q- Array is collection of similar datatype . that means an array can store multiple values of similar data type;
	 
* Java Arrays

Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value.

To declare an array, define the variable type with square brackets:

Q- Declaration  of Array in java -

syntax- datatype[] arrayname =new datatype[size];

ex- int[] arr=new int[10];
*The above array can store 10 number of int type.

Q- How to initialization of Array- 
	int []arr=n{10,20,30,40,50};
arr[0]=10
arr[1]=20
arr[2]=30
arr[3]=40
arr[4]=50

Q- How to catake input from user for an array ? 

int [] list=new int[5];
Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
int i;
System.out.println("Enter five no.");
for(i=0; i<5; i++) {
list[i]=sc.nextInt();

}


Q- String in Java:-
String is a Sequence of character. In java string is a class The object of String of class store sequence of characters.

Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
String name=sc.nextLine();

1.toUpperCase():- toUpperCase() method of String class convert String in upper case.

2.toLowerCase():- toLowerCase() method of String class convert String in Lower case.

3.Length():-  length() method of string class is use to find length of given string.

4. equals():-  equals() method of String class compare two string for equality. This method return the boolean value.

5. equalsIgnoreCase():- equalsIgnoreCase() method of String class compare to String for equality . This method avoid case sensitivity.

6. replace():-  replace() method of String class replace one String with another String in given String.

ex:- 

string sen="He is a good boy";
sen.replace("good", "sincere");

7. split():-  split() method of String Class split sting into sub-string. And this method returns array of String.

Ex:-  String sen= "He is a good boy. "

String[] words=sen.split(" ");
words[0]="He";
words[1]="is";
words[2]="a";
words[3]="good";
words[4]="boy";



___CharAt()-____________ This method of String class find character as specified location.



Method in java-
__________________________

Method is a named block of code which perform specific task. 
why Method ? :- 

If you have a block of code which is  required  different location of program. Then you can create a method of that code and call it form desired locations .

Ex:-


//Method runs only  when it called

public class Method {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int r=sum(10,20); //calling
        System.out.println("Addition : "+r);

    }
    static int sum(int a, int b) //Definition
    {
        return a+b;
    }
}


HOW TO CREATE METHOD IN JAVA: - 
__________________________________
SYNTAX: - 

Modifier returntype methodname(parameters){


}


public int sum(int x , int y) {
return(x,y);
}

types of method in java-
_____________________________

In java programming language there are two type of method.
 
1. Static method 
2. Non-static method

1. Static Method- Static method are those method which are created by using static modifier. These method are called class method. There is no need of object to called static method . 



2. Non-static- None static method without static keywords . And  non static method can called by using object. 

Note* You can create user define  method inside class and outside of main method.
 

OOPS-
_________
OOPS(Object oriented programming system). Its a mechanism of software development system. The oops has four pillars.
1. Abstraction
2. Encapsulation
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism


1. Abstraction-
____________________

Abstraction is a mechanism to show only essential functionalities and hide all other functionalities of an object.

2. Encapsulation-
_____________________

Encapsulation is a mechanism   to wrap properties and functionalities in a single unit. That's single unit is called object. 

3. Inheritance-
___________________

copied class and object an other class or object.

Concept of constructor in java- 
_______________________________
constructor is a special method which is use to initialize the variables. Constructor had following properties. 
1. Constructor name is same as class.
2. Constructor does not return any values.
3. Contractor call automatically as soon object is created.

NOTE: - 
if you not create any constructor in class, then java compiler create a default constructor in class.



This keywords-
____________________
This is a keywords which denote a object of current class. 


Inheritance: 
_________________
this is a feature of oops . In this you can create a new class by using existing class. The existing class is called based class or super class or parent class. and new created class is called derived / sub/ child class.

The concept of inheritance is also called reusability.


syntax:- 

class A {

//variable and method;

}

class B extends A{
//variable and method ;

}


Type of inheritance support in java
_________________________________________
In java programming language there are three type of inheritance of  inheritance of supported.
1. Single inheritance.
2. Hierarchical inheritance
3. Multi-level inheritance.


Single inheritance-
_______________________
In single inheritance there is a single based class and there is a derived class.

Syntax:- 

class A {

// code;
 
}
class B extends A{


//code;

}


2. Hierarchical inheritance
________________________________

In This inheritance there is a single based class and multiple derived class. 

Syntax:- 
class A{

//code;

}
class B{
//code;
}
class C extends A{
//code ;


}

3. Multi-level inheritance : 
__________________________________
In this inheritance 

syntax:

class A {
//code;
}
class B extends A{

//code ;

}
class C extends B {
//code;
}

polymorphism-
____________________
The terms polymorphism means one thing many forms.

In java there are two type of polymorphism 
1. Compile time polymorphism. - (method overloading) 
2. Runtime polymorphism. -( method overriding.)

Method  overloading-
_____________________
In java you can create multiple method with same name in same class. But there parameter should be different . Based on method parameter it is decided at complication time which method call from  where. This concept is called method overloading.

Method parameter can be different in two type.
1. number of parameter should be different.
2. type of parameter should be different.
ex:

class figure{
public int area (int s){

return s;
}
public int area(int l int b){
return l*b;

}
}




Method overriding-
_____________________

Re-writing of based class method in to derived class in called method Overriding.
Ex:-
class Connection{

public void connect(){

//code to connect oracle database

}
}
class NewConnection extends connection{
public void connect(){
//code to connect MYSQL database;

}

}

Rules for method overriding-
_______________________
1. Class must be inheritance.
2. Base class method name  and derived class method name must be same.
3. Base class method parameter and derived class method parameter must be same.
4. Baes class method return type and derived class method return type can be same.

Exception:
_______________

The terms exception means Abnormal termination. When exception is occurred the program is terminated abnormally and rest of code is not executed. 
In java program language there are three type of Exceptions:

1. Checked Exception
2. Unchecked Exception
3. Errors


1. Checked Exception-
_____________________
Checked Exception are those exception which are occurred at compilation time and intimated by compiler. 
EX:-
InterruptedException, SQLException, ClassNotFoundException, FileNotFoundException, IOException.. etc

2.Unchecked Exception-
_______________________
Unchecked Exception are those exception which are occurred at run time these exception are generated by either programmer mistake or user mistake.
EX:-
Arithmetic Exception , input mismatch Exception , null pointer Exception,  ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException...etc

3. Errors:
___________
Error are occurred due to lack of system resources. 
EX:-
IOError, AwtError, HeapMomeryError...etc.

Exception Handling in java: -
___________________________
Exception handling is a mechanism to handle  exception to achieve normal execution of program.
for exception handling you can use  'try, catch, finally,  throw and throws ' keywords. In java you can handling exception in two ways, 
1.By using try-catch blocks.
2. By using throws keywords.


Exception handling by using try and catch blocks:- 
try{
//code which you want to protect. 

}
catch(ExceptionType variable){
//code which use to handle exception. 

}
finally// optional
{
//code which you want to executed always.
 
}

NOTE: 
For a single try block there can be multiple catch blocks.
